# Writing styleguide notes

To be formalized...

## Grammar style

Grammar style notes here apply primarily to American English, but can be applied to other languages as well depending on the case.

### Title format

Page titles and section headings should be written in sentence case: most words lowercase other than the first word, proper nouns, and other [specific cases](https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/capitalization/sentence-case).

Good:
> ## How to install Apostrophe on your computer
Bad:
> ## How to Install Apostrophe on Your Computer

In most cases, punctuation should not be used at the end of titles. If the title is a question, exclamation, or quote, it would end in a question mark, exclamation point, or quotation mark, respectively.

### "Levels," "types," and other wording style

- When used as a compound adjective, "project-level" should be hyphenated (e.g., "project-level code"). When used as a noun referring to that layer of work, "project level" is not hyphenated (e.g., "add the file at project level") referring to work done in a project codebase, is not hyphenated. English is weird. Generally avoid the latter usage.
- "Content type" is not hyphenated.
- "Front end" and "back end" are not hyphenated. The dev world will never stop debating this. We have... for now.

## Code style

### Referencing code block file location

When adding code blocks that represent snippets of a file, include the location of that file at the beginning of the code block. It should be added in a comment of that file type's style and start at the root of the codebase.

Nunjucks template example:

```django
{# views/layout.html #}
```

JavaScript file example:

```javascript
// modules/@apostrophecms/admin-bar/index.js
```

### REST APIs

**REST API request types should be written as code:**

Good:
> Make a `GET` request.
Bad:
> Make a GET request.

### Highlighting lines of code in blocks

For a fun and, importantly, noticeable way to point out key lines of code in code blocks, use finger pointing emojis in comment lines.

Example:

```javascript
module.export = {
  // ðŸ‘† Everything inside this is our module.
  extend: '@apostrophecms/piece-type', // ðŸ‘ˆ This means we're in a piece type.
  // ðŸ‘‡ Here's where we configure schema fields.
  fields: {
    add: {
      // ...
    }
  }
}
```

Just don't do it that much. You'd normally not have more than one per code block, if any. In small code blocks it is usually not necessary and could feel excessive. It's especially useful in large code blocks where extra lines are needed for context, but a focal line might be missed otherwise.

```javascript
add: {
  main: {
    label: 'Main column',
    type: 'area',
    options: {
      max: 1, // ðŸ‘ˆ Limits the area to a single image widget.
      widgets: {
        '@apostrophecms/image': {}
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Screenshots

### Screenshot size

**Use an 800px by 600px screen size** if you are using a screenshot that represents most of a desktop browser window or the entire window. It should display the user interface well without being so large that the detail is hard to see. A consistent size will give readers a consistent feel and polished impression across examples.
