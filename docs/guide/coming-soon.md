# Coming Before the 3.0 Stable Release

The following features are not in our `3.0.0-alpha.2` release, but we promise, they're coming very soon. We'll be releasing these on a rolling basis as we continue our path to a stable release in Q1 2021.

### New Permissions System
A new, simplified permissions system is on its way. However, **for `3.0.0-alpha.2`, all logged-in users are treated as admins.** Again, that's just for these early alpha releases.

### Edit Mode, Drafts and Publishing
In A2, if you're not using [apostrophe-workflow](https://github.com/apostrophecms/apostrophe-workflow), your changes are saved as you author them. This remains true in `3.0.0-alpha.2`, but in the stable release there will be an explicit "Publish Changes" button for use when your work is ready to be seen, or sent to someone else for approval.

### Table editing in Tiptap

In `3.0.0-alpha.2`, our rich text editor does not yet support tables, but there is excellent support for tables in Tiptap, and we will be adding this to A3.

### Version History
In the stable release of A3 you'll be able to access the publication history of any document and roll back to a previously published version if needed.

### In-Context Only Areas
Right now, all editable Areas appear in every dialog box. In our stable release, you'll have the option to disable this for content you only want editable on the page.

### Internationalization
The stable release of A3 will ship with optional internationalization both for static text and for dynamic content. We have learned many UX lessons from `apostrophe-workflow` and are simplifying this experience.

### Image Cropping & Focal Points
Standard in 2.x, these features are still in the works for 3.x.

### Polymorphic Relationships
Formally "Polymorphic joins," a popular feature added late in the 2.x series, will reappear in 3.x before or not long after the stable release.

### And More
We have a rich ecosystem of plug-in modules for A2, and those modules will be ported to A3 as appropriate.
