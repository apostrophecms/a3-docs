# Upgrading A2 projects

- What's involved in upgrading from A2
	- Updating the database structure
		- broad strokes of what this means with a few examples of changes
	- Upgrading the code base
		- point to Coming from 2.x page to show examples of changes
		- Module configuration API
		- New widget player structure (without jQuery et al.)
		- Templating API changes
	- We have tools to help with both parts
- Point to places in documentation to reference to upgrade manually (brief pointing to sections)
	- Module overview and options reference
	- Widget player docs
	- Area templating docs
	- Media-in-templates docs
	- Macros to fragments if async (including area tags)
- Introduce tools
	- Content upgrader
		- Pretty much essential to avoid essentially reproducing it
		- Doesn't actually touch the old database (reads it)
		- Limitations:
			- doesn't migrate users due to permission complication
				- recommendation for this
			- No groups in A3, so groups not migrated
			- Core image widget doesn't support multiple images, so only grabs first image
		- Retains all original data in the new db just in case(?)
		- What you'll need to do manually
			- users, groups, image slideshows
	- Code upgrader
		- Pairs well with content upgrader to ensure a matching structure
			- Recommended istead of 100% manual migration for this reason
		- Also handles module upgrading
		- Designed to take care of the majority of a standard Apostrophe 2 code base
		- Limitations (What you'll need to do manually)
			- Deprecated properties
			- Original style widget players
			- The scanner will highlight things for you.
		-  Not meant to convert a codebase 100%, but 80%+ to let you focus on more custom pieces
	- Please tell us where these don't work!
