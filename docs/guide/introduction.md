## What is ApostropheCMS?

ApostropheCMS is a modern, open source, content management system. It's Javascript from front to back, with a Vue.js user interface and Node.js on the server. Importantly, it has everything you might want from a modern CMS, including:

- a headless API built-in
- a content schema API to create any kind of content types you need
- extensibility through a module ecosystem
- a great UI for creating content, including in-context editing
- robust localization to support any number of language or locale content variations

For developers, it offers a site building API that gives you the power to fully customize the website experience without needing to be a Node.js expert. For content editors, the _true_ WYSIWYG experience supports improved editorial flow.

In short, it recognizes pain points on both sides of the CMS experience and relieves them.
