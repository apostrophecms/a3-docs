# Users and user roles

A **"user"** in Apostrophe is an account (usually for a human or benevolent robot) that can be used to log into the website. Beyond that, users get specific sets of permissions based on the **role** they are assigned. More on that to come.

The first and most important thing to know with regards to permissions is that **only admin users can create and manage other users.**
