# Changes from Apostrophe 2

Apostrophe 3 (A3) has many things to offer developers familiar with Apostrophe 2 (A2). It has a totally new UI, clearer module configuration, and many quality of life improvements, large and small. Its been re-engineered from the ground-up to provide a best-in-class experience for organizations of all sizes.

There are also some breaking changes, including in the general directory structure, so be sure to review the [upgrading guide](/guide/migration/upgrading.md) before upgrading codebases.

## Features

### 100% RESTful API coverage

In the previous version, developers who wanted REST API access to their data needed to install the `apostrophe-headless` module. [This is now built into A3](/reference/api/) and is the foundation of the user interface.

### Totally rebuilt content editing interface

The UI has been completely rebuilt with [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/). It is much faster, more accessible, and easier to configure. It will also stay out of your way, so you can build with React, vanilla JavaScript, a different Vue.js version, or any other framework without any issue.

### Clearer and easier module building

There were several things about building advanced modules in A2 that often tripped up developers. A3 helps avoid the confusion around where to put things by doing away with `beforeConstruct`, `construct`, and `afterConstruct`. [They are replaced by a single `init` function and special sections](/reference/module-api/module-overview.md#initialization-function) to do things like extend API routes, add template helper methods, and add columns to the piece manager UI. The `addFields` array also became a `fields` object with an `add` subproperty to prevent problems with common inheritance patterns.

### New Rich Text Editor

A3 uses the [tiptap](https://tiptap.dev/) rich text editor, a modern, open source editor powered by [ProseMirror](https://prosemirror.net/) and built by Ã¼berdosis. Besides being a great editor, it is built with JavaScript, which should make it easier to customize for developers using a Node.js CMS.

### Async template components

[Async components](/guide/async-components.md) allow developers to write template code that uses data from custom database requests. In A2, the pattern to make those requests before rendering templates was unclear and fairly advanced. Async components should make this a clearer process and improve rendering performance.

## Other improvements

- Callback-driven code has been completely eliminated from the core of Apostrophe, and all of the JavaScript APIs return promises, so you can `await` them in async functions.
- A3 completely removes the jQuery, lodash, and Moment.js libraries that were pushed to browsers by default. There is now only [a small set of helper methods](/guide/front-end-helpers.md).
- In addition to the classic template macros, there are now [fragments](/guide/fragments.md). These are compatible with the new async components, unlike macros.
- [Content localization](localization/dynamic.md), which was a feature of Apostrophe Workflow for A2, is now fully available in A3 core.

There are additional features planned for Apostrophe 3. Keep an eye on the [product roadmap](https://portal.productboard.com/apostrophecms/1-product-roadmap/tabs/2-planned) for more on those.
