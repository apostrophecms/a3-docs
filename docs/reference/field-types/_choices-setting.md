The `choices` setting in `checkboxes`, `radio`, or `select` fields configures the options that a user will see in the interface and the values that the server will allow in validation. The `choices` value is an array of objects with `label` and `value` properties.

- `value` is used in the field's database value
- `label` is the more human-readable version used in interfaces
