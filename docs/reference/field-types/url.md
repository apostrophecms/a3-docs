# `url`

`url` adds an editable URL field to the schema.

Apostrophe will detect common mistakes, including leaving off `https://`. Common XSS attack vectors are laundered and discarded. Only "safe" URL schemes, e.g., `http`, `https`, `ftp` and `mailto`, are permitted.

## Module field definition

```javascript
// Configuring the `portfolio` field in a module's `fields.add` subsection:
portfolio: {
  label: 'Portfolio URL',
  type: 'url'
}
```

### autocomplete
The string supplied to the `autocomplete` option is used as the value of the `autocomplete` attribute for the field, as specified in the HTML standards. This feature suggests possible values based on user inputs and previously entered data, streamlining data entry and improving form usability. This also takes a string of `off` to disable autocomplete for sensitive fields. For detailed information on how the `autocomplete` attribute works and the values it accepts, refer to the [MDN documentation on autocomplete](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/autocomplete).
