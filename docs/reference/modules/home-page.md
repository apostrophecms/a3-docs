# `@apostrophecms/home-page`

This module sets up a page type used for the home page in the official Apostrophe starter project. It does not have any special fields or content areas by default, though the [default starter does provide some](https://github.com/apostrophecms/a3-boilerplate/blob/main/modules/%40apostrophecms/home-page/index.js).

See [the page types guide](/guide/pages.md#activating-page-types) for information about using this and other page types.
